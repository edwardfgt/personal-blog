I've been studying Mandarin for many years now, and whilst I'd consider myself intermediate, there is still a huge wall of vocab to be learned before, sometimes it feels never ending. I also recently staretd picking up some Cantonese vocab over the past month, I haven't started actively studying Cantonese before I thought it would be useful to log the vocab that I have learnt for both languages in April 2024.
