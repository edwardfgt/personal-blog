I recently finished reading A Line In The Sand by James Barr, I wanted to learn more about the region after feeling a little ignorant when the conflict between Israel and Palestine reheated up in October, this book was recommended by the FT as it gives a good background into how the region has been shaped by its colonial past.

The book is close to 400 pages long and took longer than I was expecting, mainly because it was sometimes hard to keep track of names and places!

Here are some of the things that I learnt or found super interesting.

## France vs France

During WW2, after Nazi Germany occupied France, the country was split into two groups, the existing "Free French" government and the Vichy French.

The Vichy French decided to collaborate with the Germans, partly out of necessity to try and preserve some of their French culture and to avoid further bloodshed in Nazi occupied areas. Now the dilemma for France's many colonies at the time was which government should they serve? 

Many of the generals in these colonies were already nearing retirement and had family back in France who's safety they feared, meaning that a lot of the colonies ended up siding with the Vichy French and therefore became aligned with the Germans. 

One big controversial event that happened during this time was the British sinking of the French fleet in Algeria. See, Britain was worried that the Vichy French would either hand over the fleet to the Germans, or the Germans would simply seize it. So the British made the decision to sink the entire fleet, resulting in over 1200 French sailors dieing. Many still see this as a betrayal. 

Furthermore, with the French Colonies siding with the Germans, there was a large conflict between the Allies including Britain and the Free French, versus the vichy French in North Africa. Esentially France vs France. 

## The drawing of borders



## France and the UK really didn't like each other

## Jewish immigration to Palestine

Before and after WW2, Britain was actually opposed to mass Jewish immigration to Palestine (which was still a British colony at that time).

Britain wanted to maintain good relations with the surrounding Arab countries who it relied on good relationships with for oil. 

However intense lobbying from Zionist groups in the US which had real influence on elections, resulted in the US government putting pressure on Britain. Furthermore. Jewish terrorist organisations, including the Stern Gang which had secret French support in Palestine put intense pressure on the British goverment which eventually decided to step back.
