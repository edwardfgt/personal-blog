Finding good cafes in China can be hard, especially with the lack of content online in English.

Luckily for you, before I recently went to Xian, I delved through Chinese apps and social media to find some good cafes. Here are the cafes that I enjoyed the most!

I'll provide the addresses in Chinese, as well as a link to find the location.

I'd recommend using 高德地图 for your mapping needs whilst in China. You can download it on the App Store or Google Play. 

## Oops Coffee ()

We were seriously impressed by the Coffee at Oops Cafe, we actually went here twice in our 4 day trip.

The first we ordered 一豆三喝 - Which means 1 bean 3 drinks. Esentially a selection of three drinks made from one bean.

The drink pictured in the middle was seriously one of the best cold coffees me and my girlfriend have ever tried, and we don't say that lightly.

Our Chinese isn't good enough to understand complex coffee making vocab, but it sounded like the thick foam on top is made with a blender and flavour is enhanced with Costa Rican Plum Wine.

We came back again on our last day, this time I had a flat white and my girlfriend had an Iced Latte (or maybe it was a iced dirty latte, I forget). Both also tasted great and we were very happy.

The cafe interior is also very nice, with lots of space upstairs. 

I'm going to go out on a whim and say this is probably the best cafe in Xian. If there is a better one, please let me know, but I'd be seriously surprised!
